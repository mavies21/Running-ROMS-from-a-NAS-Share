make sure smb is enabled in retropie setup of retropie,

then continue with the mount using fstab,

make sure the user is setup correctly on the nas,
to do so:
> create a user for retropie,
> give the retropie user access to the roms folder and the roms inside,
> make sure the retropie user can read and write.

PS. i have absolutely no clue what "nounix,noserverino,defaults,users,auto 0 0" does at the end of the fstab.
